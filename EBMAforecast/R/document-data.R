#' Calibration sample data
#'
#' #' This includes the calibration-sample data for the international conflict forecasting example in Montgomery, Hollenbach and Ward (2012). It provides the predictions for the three models included in the Ensemble models, as well as the true values of the dependent variable for insurgency in 29 Asian countries. The calibration sample ranges ranges from January 2008 to December 2009.

#' This includes the test-sample data for the international conflict forecasting example in Montgomery, Hollenbach and Ward (2012). It provides the predictions for the three models included in the Ensemble models, as well as the true values of the dependent variable for insurgency in 29 Asian countries. The test sample ranges ranges from January 2010 to December 2010.

#' EBMAforecast
#'
#' The EBMAforecast package (currently under development) allows users to increase the accuracy of forecasting models by pooling multiple component forecasts to generate ensemble forecasts. It includes functions to fit an ensemble Bayesian model averaging (EBMA) model using in-sample predictions, generate ensemble out-of-sample predictions, and create useful data visualizations
